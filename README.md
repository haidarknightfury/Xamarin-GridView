# Xamarin-GridView


so i did this in my free time.it doesn't actually exist in the xamarin.forms
this is a work around.the actual codes that automatically adds in the grid view is from the code behind

using the class id attribute i made sure that each frame matches the id of an object which i could easily find when tapped

enjoy!!
